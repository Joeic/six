#  Examples of Good Software Practice (GSP)
DRY- I put every repeated code into one method, so that I can directly use them instead of write the same code again and 
again.
Well named, commented, short methods that do a specific job and return a specific result. - I named every methods clearly that 
I see what they can do as long as I see their names
Testing strategies- For testing part, I not only test the correct output, but also tested incorrected output and exception. I 
can come up with every situation to test to avoid tests failure.
